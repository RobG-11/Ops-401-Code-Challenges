# Script: 33 - Signature-based Malware Detection Part 3 of 3 - COMPLETE
# Author: Robert Gregor
# Date of latest revision: 01 JUL 23

# Staging (PART III)
    # Copy and paste the demo script into a new Python file on your system
    # Download virustotal-search.py and place it in the same folder as the demo Python script
    # Sign up for an account at virustotal.com to get a free API key
    # To query VirusTotal API, need to set API key as environment variable to avoid hard-coding
        # You can always hard-code it at first for testing, but don’t leave it that way!
    # Set the variable hash to whatever MD5 hash you wish VirusTotal to evaluate.

# Objectives (PART III) - Add to your malware detection script features to:
    # Successfully connect to VirusTotal API
    # Automatically compare target file’s md5 hash with hash values of entries on VirusTotal API
    # Print to the screen the number of positives detected and total files scanned
    # Script must successfully execute on both Ubuntu Linux 20.04 Focal Fossa and Windows 10
