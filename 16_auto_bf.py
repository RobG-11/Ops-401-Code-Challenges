# Script: 16 - Automated Brute Force Wordlist Attack Tool Part 1 of 3
# Author: Robert Gregor
# Date of latest revision: 08 MAY 23

# Objectives (PART I)
    # In Python, create a script that prompts the user to select one of the following modes:
        # Mode 1: Offensive; Dictionary Iterator
            # Accepts user input word list file path
                # Iterates through the word list, assigning the word being read to a variable.
            # Add a delay between words.
            # Print to the screen the value of the variable
        # Mode 2: Defensive; Password Recognized
            # Accepts a user input string.
            # Accepts a user input word list file path.
            # Search the word list for the user input string.
            # Print to the screen whether the string appeared in the word list.
        # Mode 3: Defensive; Password Complexity (STRETCH GOAL)
            # Accepts a user input string.
                # Evaluates the user input string for password complexity
            # Impose a requirement in your code for the below metrics:
                # Were at least [qty] characters used (password length)?
                # Were at least [qty] capital letter used?
                # Were at least [qty] numbers used?
                # Were at least [qty] symbols used?
            # Prints to the screen which of the above dimensions were satisfied by the user input password. 
                # If all dimensions are satisfied, print a clear SUCCESS indicator for the user.
