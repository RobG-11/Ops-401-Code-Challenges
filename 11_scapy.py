# Script: 11 - Scapy (Part I)
# Author: Robert Gregor
# Date of latest revision: 01 MAY 23

# Objectives
    # In Python, create a TCP Port Range Scanner that tests whether a TCP port is open or closed. The script must:
        # Utilize the scapy library, define host IP, define port range or specific set of ports to scan
        # Test each port in the specified range using a for loop
            # If flag 0x12 received, send a RST packet to graciously close the open connection
                # Notify the user the port is open.
            # If flag 0x14 received, notify user the port is closed.
            # If no flag is received, notify the user the port is filtered and silently dropped.
