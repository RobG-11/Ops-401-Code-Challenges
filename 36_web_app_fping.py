# Script: 36 - Web Application Fingerprinting **COMPLETE**
# Author: Robert Gregor
# Date of latest revision: 06 JUN 23

# Objectives - Create a script that executes from a Linux box to perform the following:
    # Prompts the user to type a URL or IP address and a port number
    # Performs banner grabbing using netcat against target address at target port
        # Prints results to screen then moves on to step below
    # Performs banner grabbing using telnet against target address at target port
        # Prints results to screen then moves on to step below
    # Performs banner grabbing using Nmap against the target address of all well-known ports
        # Prints the results to the screen
