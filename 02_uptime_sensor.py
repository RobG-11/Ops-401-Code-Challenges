# Script: 02 - Uptime Sensor Tool
# Author: Robert Gregor
# Date of latest revision: 18 APR 23

# Objectives
    # In Python, create an uptime sensor tool that uses ICMP packets to evaluate if hosts on the LAN are up or down
        # Transmit a single ICMP (ping) packet to a specific IP every two seconds
        # Evaluate the response as either success or failure
        # Assign success or failure to a status variable
        # For every ICMP transmission attempted, print status variable along with comprehensive timestamp and destination IP tested
            # Example output: 2020-10-05 17:57:57.510261 Network Active to 8.8.8.8

# Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)
    # In Python, add the below features to your uptime sensor tool
        # Save the output to a text file as a log of events
        # Accept user input for target IP address
