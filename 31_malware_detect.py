# Date of latest revision: 30 MAY 23

# Objectives (PART IV) - In Python, write a script that will:
    # Prompt the user to type in a file name to search for
    # Prompt the user for a directory to search in
    # Search each file in the directory by name
        # TIP: May need to perform different commands depending on  OS youâ€™re executing script on
    # For each positive detection, print to the screen the file name and location
    # At the end of the search process
        # Print to the screen how many files were searched and how many hits were found
    # The script must successfully execute on both Ubuntu Linux 20.04 Focal Fossa and Windows 10
